"""review_report — the signable record of the inquiry (RT-5).

**What is being sold here.** Not the answer. Under 37 CFR 11.18(b) a practitioner's
certification is **non-delegable**, so the artifact a professional can actually buy is the
*record of the inquiry* — what was searched, what was found, what was rejected, what was
declined, and under exactly what declared limits. The landscape survey found this is what
the one commercially successful comparable monetises, and that Cairn already holds the
substrate no surveyed competitor matches: a hash-chained log, byte-identical replay,
contract-stamped provenance.

**Two wording rules, load-bearing rather than stylistic.** This document must say it
*evidences*, *documents* and *supports* an inquiry — never that it *satisfies*, *ensures*
or *completes* one. A record that implies search breadth it does not have is a liability
artifact, not an asset; retrieval here is a ranked BM25 slice, not an exhaustive search,
and the report says so where a reader cannot miss it. Everything the tool declines to
conclude stays declined (D10: locate & evidence, never adjudicate).

**Structure follows D33's discipline:** the limits arrive *before* the findings. A caveat
a reader meets at the end is a caveat that did not work.

Open intake questions this builds against (stated, not assumed away):
  · **Q13** — which analysis the client wants. This module is deliberately orthogonal:
    it wraps whatever interactions the audit log holds, so answering Q13 changes the
    *content* of a report and not its shape.
  · **Q16** — delivery form. Defaulted to a self-contained HTML page: no server, emailable,
    prints to PDF for signature, and matches every other surface in the repo.
